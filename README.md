I am working on simply copying the design of the google search homepage without the use of developer tools.

Initialy I though that flexbox was going to be useful on the navigational bars, but it was not. It ended up being extremely useful in the assembly of the actual search input structure at the center of the bage.

The top and bottom navigational bars are actualy each split into two, with the right-hand pieces floated and the left-hand pieces left alone.
